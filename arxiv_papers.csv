An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning,"I describe an optimal control view of adversarial machine learning, where the
dynamical system is the machine learner, the input are adversarial actions, and
the control costs are defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard
to detect. This view encompasses many types of adversarial machine learning,
including test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward
shaping. The view encourages adversarial machine learning researcher to utilize
advances in control theory and reinforcement learning."
"Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples","The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine
learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are
looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is
free of those flaws."
Machine Learning for Clinical Predictive Analytics,"In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of applying machine learning
techniques for clinical prediction tasks. We begin with a quick introduction to
the concepts of machine learning and outline some of the most common machine
learning algorithms. Next, we demonstrate how to apply the algorithms with
appropriate toolkits to conduct machine learning experiments for clinical
prediction tasks. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) understand the
basics of machine learning techniques and the reasons behind why they are
useful for solving clinical prediction problems, (2) understand the intuition
behind some machine learning models, including regression, decision trees, and
support vector machines, and (3) understand how to apply these models to
clinical prediction problems using publicly available datasets via case
studies."
"Towards Modular Machine Learning Solution Development: Benefits and
  Trade-offs","Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in
various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.
However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched
potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve
unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of
machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature
prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of
efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.
In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and
discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major
solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We
analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning
solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two
image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning
solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering
advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way
the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit."

The Tribes of Machine Learning and the Realm of Computer Architecture,"Machine learning techniques have influenced the field of computer
architecture like many other fields. This paper studies how the fundamental
machine learning techniques can be applied towards computer architecture
problems. We also provide a detailed survey of computer architecture research
that employs different machine learning methods. Finally, we present some
future opportunities and the outstanding challenges that need to be overcome to
exploit full potential of machine learning for computer architecture."
"A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I:
  Traditional Machine Learning","Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly.
While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine
learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required
to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to
perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users
are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.
To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy
towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some
of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example
is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing
machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning
methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision
trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support
vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also
contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best
practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.
Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory
notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to
catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology."
Position Paper: Towards Transparent Machine Learning,"Transparent machine learning is introduced as an alternative form of machine
learning, where both the model and the learning system are represented in
source code form. The goal of this project is to enable direct human
understanding of machine learning models, giving us the ability to learn,
verify, and refine them as programs. If solved, this technology could represent
a best-case scenario for the safety and security of AI systems going forward."
Understanding Bias in Machine Learning,"Bias is known to be an impediment to fair decisions in many domains such as
human resources, the public sector, health care etc. Recently, hope has been
expressed that the use of machine learning methods for taking such decisions
would diminish or even resolve the problem. At the same time, machine learning
experts warn that machine learning models can be biased as well. In this
article, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a
technical perspective and to illustrate the impact that biased data can have on
a machine learning model. To reach such a goal, we develop interactive plots to
visualizing the bias learned from synthetic data."
"A Unified Analytical Framework for Trustable Machine Learning and
  Automation Running with Blockchain","Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are
mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine
learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a
trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can
store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are
used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three
contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology
and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have
been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second,
it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by
using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the
trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a
computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread
on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with
blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining
as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented
with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid
prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis."
"MLBench: How Good Are Machine Learning Clouds for Binary Classification
  Tasks on Structured Data?","We conduct an empirical study of machine learning functionalities provided by
major cloud service providers, which we call machine learning clouds. Machine
learning clouds hold the promise of hiding all the sophistication of running
large-scale machine learning: Instead of specifying how to run a machine
learning task, users only specify what machine learning task to run and the
cloud figures out the rest. Raising the level of abstraction, however, rarely
comes free - a performance penalty is possible. How good, then, are current
machine learning clouds on real-world machine learning workloads?
  We study this question with a focus on binary classication problems. We
present mlbench, a novel benchmark constructed by harvesting datasets from
Kaggle competitions. We then compare the performance of the top winning code
available from Kaggle with that of running machine learning clouds from both
Azure and Amazon on mlbench. Our comparative study reveals the strength and
weakness of existing machine learning clouds and points out potential future
directions for improvement."
Data Pricing in Machine Learning Pipelines,"Machine learning is disruptive. At the same time, machine learning can only
succeed by collaboration among many parties in multiple steps naturally as
pipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine
learning applications, collaboratively training models by multiple parties and
delivering machine learning services to end users. Data is critical and
penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning
pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a
constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are
fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article,
we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in
machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces
and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in
machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data
collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also
investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning
models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step
of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future
directions."
Techniques for Automated Machine Learning,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to find optimal machine learning
solutions automatically given a machine learning problem. It could release the
burden of data scientists from the multifarious manual tuning process and
enable the access of domain experts to the off-the-shelf machine learning
solutions without extensive experience. In this paper, we review the current
developments of AutoML in terms of three categories, automated feature
engineering (AutoFE), automated model and hyperparameter learning (AutoMHL),
and automated deep learning (AutoDL). State-of-the-art techniques adopted in
the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization,
reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradient-based approaches.
We summarize popular AutoML frameworks and conclude with current open
challenges of AutoML."

has become an indispensable part of cutting-edge technology, scientific
research and consumer products. In this study, we present a review of modern
machine and deep learning. We provide a high-level overview for the latest
advanced machine learning algorithms, applications, and frameworks. Our
discussion encompasses parallel distributed learning, deep learning as well as
federated learning. As a result, our work serves as an introductory text to the
vast field of modern machine learning."
"Parallelization of Machine Learning Algorithms Respectively on Single
  Machine and Spark","With the rapid development of big data technologies, how to dig out useful
information from massive data becomes an essential problem. However, using
machine learning algorithms to analyze large data may be time-consuming and
inefficient on the traditional single machine. To solve these problems, this
paper has made some research on the parallelization of several classic machine
learning algorithms respectively on the single machine and the big data
platform Spark. We compare the runtime and efficiency of traditional machine
learning algorithms with parallelized machine learning algorithms respectively
on the single machine and Spark platform. The research results have shown
significant improvement in runtime and efficiency of parallelized machine
learning algorithms."
AutoCompete: A Framework for Machine Learning Competition,"In this paper, we propose AutoCompete, a highly automated machine learning
framework for tackling machine learning competitions. This framework has been
learned by us, validated and improved over a period of more than two years by
participating in online machine learning competitions. It aims at minimizing
human interference required to build a first useful predictive model and to
assess the practical difficulty of a given machine learning challenge. The
proposed system helps in identifying data types, choosing a machine learn- ing
model, tuning hyper-parameters, avoiding over-fitting and optimization for a
provided evaluation metric. We also observe that the proposed system produces
better (or comparable) results with less runtime as compared to other
approaches."
Joint Training of Deep Boltzmann Machines,"We introduce a new method for training deep Boltzmann machines jointly. Prior
methods require an initial learning pass that trains the deep Boltzmann machine
greedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classifi- cation
tasks."
